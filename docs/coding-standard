Golden Rule: Imitate the code from template.cpp and template.h. And what you see around.



Indentations: use ONLY white spaces. 1 indentation == 4 white spaces.

Comments: use multiline comments for multiline text and single line comments for single lines of text.

Names: short names for simple things, long names for complex.

File Names: use lower case characters and underscores (a-z and _) for names of .h and .cpp files.
